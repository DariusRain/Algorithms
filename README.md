# Algorithm Practice

Leap Year Identifier: <br />
	Implemented this program with readline and used functional programming methodolgy to solve the problem in a clean way. 
<br />
Factorial: <br />
	Used recursion to solve this algorithm.
<br />

Counting Valleys: <br />
	In this algorithm you count the amount of valleys based on the location <br />
	of a person's steps.  Where negative integers starting from -1 represents <br />
	an entrance to a valley.  Solved using a for loop to iterate an array of positive & negative <br />
	integers and setting.

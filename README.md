#### [Counting Valleys](#):

    In this algorithm you count the amount of valleys based on the location <br />
    of a person's steps.  Where negative integers starting from -1 represents <br />
    an entrance to a valley.  Solved using a for loop to iterate an array of positive & negative <br />
    integers and setting.

#### [Factorial](#):

    Used recursion to solve this algorithm.

#### [Leap Year Identifier](#):
    Implemented this program with readline and used functional programming methodolgy to solve the problem in a clean way.

#### [Plus Minus](https://github.com/DariusRain/algorithm-practice/blob/master/plus-minus.js):
Count how many negative, positive and zero integers are in the array and divide them by the arrays length <br/> for a decimal number representing the ratio of each.
